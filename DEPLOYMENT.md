├── templates/          # HTML templates
│   ├── login.html
│   └── chat.html
├── requirements.txt    # Python dependencies
├── Procfile           # Railway startup command
├── runtime.txt        # Python version
├── railway.json       # Railway configuration
└── README.md          # Documentation
```

### **Step 2: Deploy to Railway**

1. **Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)**
2. **Sign up/Login** with your GitHub account
3. **Click "New Project"**
4. **Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"**
5. **Choose your repository** (chat-room-project)
6. **Railway will automatically detect Python and deploy**

### **Step 3: Configure Environment Variables**
